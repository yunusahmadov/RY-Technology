   "about1": "For many years, our company Metlab has been developing the PractiCAM™ system, as well as PractiCAD™ software for automatic design of ductwork.Over the years, we have paid close attention to each user’s requests and suggestions, listened to the challenges faced in production, and done everything we could to make your job easier (long-time users know this well). For 17 years, we have continuously improved our products based on your feedback and ideas. It's worth noting that PractiCAM™ was not only developed — it was invented, because it’s based on completely new fitting generation principles that no one had implemented before.",
   "about2":"The core principles of the PractiCAM™ system were formed through constant cooperation and dialogue with businesses working in sheet metal cutting. Our goal is to make your production process as simple as possible. Whenever we spot a new opportunity for improvement in the workflow, we aim to implement it in the software as soon as possible. Learning to use PractiCAM™ is easy. With just a few hours of experience (assuming your equipment is already installed and connected), you can start getting good results. Some features (like working with specifications) may take more time to master, but once you understand the core concepts, you're good to go."
